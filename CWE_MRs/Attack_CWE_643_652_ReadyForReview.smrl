 * Real Cases of CWE  652: https://www.securecodewarrior.com/blog/coders-conquer-security-share-learn-series-xquery-injection
 *      https://www.securecodewarrior.com/blog/coders-conquer-security-share-learn-series-xquery-injection
 * 
 * FABRIZIO: we need a concrete case to test with
 * 
 * Nazanin: 
 * Cases that I have checked for CWE 643:
 * http://projects.webappsec.org/w/page/13247005/XPath%20Injection
 * https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/10372
 * 
 * It can be merged to CWE_703, if we also filter the "' or 1=1 or ''='" and single quotation mark as special characters.
 * 
 * 
 * CWE Definition:
 * The software uses external input to dynamically construct an XPath expression 
 * used to retrieve data from an XML database, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly 
 * neutralizes that input. This allows an attacker to control the structure of the query.
 * 
 * OWASP hint:
 * with XPath injection, the first step is to insert a single quote (') in the field to 
 * be tested, introducing a syntax error in the query, and to check whether the application 
 * returns an error message.
 * 
 * Comments:
 * (1) For loop iterates over all actions of the Input(1)
 * (2) Store the parameters of the current action in a variable
 * (3) It checks if the current action of the Input(1) is login.
 * (4) Creates Input(2) as the follow-up input.
 * (5) Set the specific value for the username of the Input(2)
 * (6) Set the (') value for the password of the Input(2)
 * //FABRIZIO: based on the description in http://projects.webappsec.org/w/page/13247005/XPath%20Injection
 * 				if you replace the username with "' or 1=1 or ''='"
 * 				you shall not replace also the password field, no?
 * // Nazanin: In the example they replaced the password with a string value 'foobar', as a point from OWASP, I replaced a single quotation for password. it is possible to even divide it into two MRs.
 * 
 * (7) The system should show an error page
 *      Or the user should retrieve the content that has right to access it.
