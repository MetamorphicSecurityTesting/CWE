 * A login operation should not succeed if performed on the HTTP channel.
 *  
 * The 1st parameter of the operator IMPLIES is a boolean expression with three clauses 
 * joined with logical conjunctions. 
 * The 1st clause checks if the current action performs a log in. 
 * The 2nd clause defines the follow-up input. 
 * The 3rd clause changes the channel of the login action in the follow-up input. 
 * 
 * The 2nd parameter of IMPLIES checks if the current action is under an encrypted channel, 
 * or the output generated by the login operation is different in the two cases.
