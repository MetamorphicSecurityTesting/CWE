/**
 * CWE Definition:
 * The product receives a request, message, or directive from an upstream component, but the product 
 * does not sufficiently preserve the original source of the request before forwarding the request 
 * to an external actor that is outside of the product's control sphere. This causes the product to 
 * appear to be the source of the request, leading it to act as a proxy or other intermediary between 
 * the upstream component and the external actor.
 *   
 * Idea:
 * A file path passed in the URL of a request should never enable a 
 * user to access data that is not provided by the user interface.
 * 
 *** Real case: https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2009-0037.html
 * 
 * Comments:
 * (1) For loop iterates for 3 times to cover multiple occurrence of the special character as well.             // WHY???
 * (2) Second for loop iterates over all actions of the Input(1).
 * (3) Stores the parameters of the current action in a variable.
 * (4) Defines the new URL.
 * (5) Verifies whether the current action contains any protocols.
 * (6) Checks if the current action has not been performed.
 * (7) Defines a follow-up input that is a copy of the source input.
 * (8) Adds to the end of the current URL a relative path to a file.
 * (9) Verifies that the given path was not tried in a previous execution of the loop (to speed up).
 * (10) Verifies that the follow-up input does not lead to a file 
 *      Or the returned file is something that the user has the right to access.
 *      Or the system shows an error page.
