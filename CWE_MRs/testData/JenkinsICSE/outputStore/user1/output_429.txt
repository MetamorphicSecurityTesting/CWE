New Item [Jenkins] Skip to content Jenkins User1 My Views All Enter an item name » Required field » This field cannot be empty, please enter a valid name » Please select an item type Standalone Projects Create projects with a self-contained configuration and history. These projects can be at the top-level or grouped within folders. Freestyle project This is the central feature of Jenkins. Jenkins will build your project, combining any SCM with any build system, and this can be even used for something other than software build. Pipeline Orchestrates long-running activities that can span multiple build agents. Suitable for building pipelines (formerly known as workflows) and/or organizing complex activities that do not easily fit in free-style job type. Multi-configuration project Suitable for projects that need a large number of different configurations, such as testing on multiple environments, platform-specific builds, etc. Nested Projects Create project categories or project hierarchies with folders. Folders can be created manually or automatically based on repositories. Folder Creates a container that stores nested items in it. Useful for grouping things together. Unlike view, which is just a filter, a folder creates a separate namespace, so you can have multiple things of the same name as long as they are in different folders. GitHub Organization Scans a GitHub organization (or user account) for all repositories matching some defined markers. Multibranch Pipeline Creates a set of Pipeline projects according to detected branches in one SCM repository.
