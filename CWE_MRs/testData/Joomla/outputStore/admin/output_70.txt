PayPal made the announcement in a statement on Friday, but did not specify what had prompted the decision. Libra, and its digital wallet Calibra, were revealed by Facebook in June. But the cryptocurrency has been criticised by regulators, and both France and Germany have pledged to block it from Europe. PayPal said it "[remained] supportive of Libra's aspirations" but had chosen to focus on its own core businesses. The firm was one of the original members of the Libra Association, a group of 28 companies and non-profits helping to develop Libra. Its other members include payments company Visa, ride-hailing app Uber and humanitarian charity Mercy Corps. In response to PayPal's withdrawal, Libra Association said it was aware that attempts to "reconfigure the financial system" would be hard. "Commitment to that mission is more important to us than anything else," it said in a statement. "We're better off knowing about this lack of commitment now."

Facebook said Libra would be independently-managed and backed by real assets, and that paying with it would be as easy as texting. But there have been concerns about how people's money and data will be protected, as well as over the potential volatility of the currency. The Group of Seven advanced economies warned in July that it would not let Libra proceed until all regulatory concerns had been addressed. Central bank chiefs, including the UK's Mark Carney, have also voiced scepticism, and US President Donald Trump has tweeted he is "not a fan" of the currency. The Libra Association will hold the first meeting of its governing body - the Libra Council - on 14 October. The group said in a tweet that it planned to share updates soon afterwards about "1,500 entities that have indicated enthusiastic interest to participate". Facebook's Libra could be misused, says treasury chief Mnuchin Checked out Details Written by Author 1 Category: News Published: 07 October 2019 FieldSpecial: Give more info By Russell Hotten BBC News, New York   Image copyrightGETTY IMAGES Facebook's planned Libra cryptocurrency faced further opposition on Monday when the US treasury secretary warned about its potential criminal use. Steven Mnuchin told a press conference it could be used by "money launderers and terrorist financiers" and said it was a national security issue. He was "not comfortable" about Libra, joining President Donald Trump and the US central bank in voicing concern. Facebook executives will appear before a congressional committee on Tuesday. David Marcus, who will oversee Libra, is expected to tell the Senate Banking Committee that Facebook will not launch the currency until regulatory concerns are addressed. Mr Mnuchin said Libra would have to convince financial regulators it has high privacy standards. He declined to comment on any regulatory timeline for Libra, but said he was "not comfortable today" about digital currency and that Facebook was a "long way away from" securing approval. Cryptocurrencies generally "have been exploited to support billions of dollars of illicit activity like cyber crime, tax evasion, extortion, ransomware, illicit drugs and human human trafficking," Mr Mnuchin said. Failure to act Last week, Mr Trump tweeted that he was "not a fan" of cryptocurrencies, and hinted that Facebook might need a banking licence. Jerome Powell, head of the Federal Reserve, also said last week that Libra raises many serious concerns. The tech giant, which hoped to launch Libra next year, has said it "anticipated critical feedback" and is keen to have "conversations" with officials and regulators. In prepared testimony released on Monday ahead of Tuesday's senate hearing, Mr Marcus said: "The Libra Association, which will manage the [Libra] reserve, has no intention of competing with any sovereign currencies or entering the monetary policy arena. "Monetary policy is properly the province of central banks," he said. "Facebook will not offer the Libra digital currency until we have fully addressed regulatory concerns and received appropriate approvals." Mr Marcus said the US must lead innovation in digital currencies, adding: "If we fail to act, we could soon see a digital currency controlled by others whose values are dramatically different."
