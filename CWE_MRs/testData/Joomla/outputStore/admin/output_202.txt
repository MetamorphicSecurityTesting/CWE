<p><span class="publication-date index-body">The most buzzy, artistic places on the planet are not the ones you might expect – Libby Banks explores what actually makes a cultural hub.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="publication-date index-body">There is an assumption that creativity is all about individual genius. In truth, the big creative breakthroughs are also a social process, often occurring when a diverse population comes together. Historically, cities are an essential ingredient for creating great art, from Classical Athens and Renaissance Florence to post-war New York and swinging London.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="publication-date index-body">And where the artists go, others follow. In recent decades the process of gentrification has become well established. The academic Richard Florida popularised the theory in the early 2000s that creativity enables urban development: bohemians and artists move to inner-city, working-class or abandoned industrial areas in search of cheaper accommodation and studio space. They make a place fun and interesting, and the creative middle classes are then drawn to these open-minded  communities ­ – and the culture and amenities that come with them.</span></p>
