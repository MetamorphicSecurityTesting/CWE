Knowing some of the basics will help.</p><h3>What is a Content Management System?</h3><p>A content management system is software that allows you to create and manage webpages easily by separating the creation of your content from the mechanics required to present it on the web.</p><p>In this site, the content is stored in a <em>database</em>. The look and feel are created by a <em>template</em>. Joomla! brings together the template and your content to create web pages.</p><h3>Logging in</h3><p>To login to your site use the user name and password that were created as part of the installation process. Once logged-in you will be able to create and edit articles and modify some settings.</p><h3>Creating an article</h3><p>Once you are logged-in, a new menu will be visible. To create a new article, click on the "Submit Article" link on that menu.</p><p>The new article interface gives you a lot of options, but all you need to do is add a title and put something in the content area. To make it easy to find, set the state to published.</p><div>You can edit an existing article by clicking on the edit icon (this only displays to users who have the right to edit).</div><h3>Template, site settings, and modules</h3><p>The look and feel of your site is controlled by a template. You can change the site name, background colour, highlights colour and more by editing the template settings. Click the "Template Settings" in the user menu.</p><p>The boxes around the main content of the site are called modules. You can modify modules on the current page by moving your cursor to the module and clicking the edit link. Always be sure to save and close any module you edit.</p><p>You can change some site settings such as the site name and description by clicking on the "Site Settings" link.</p><p>More advanced options for templates, site settings, modules, and more are available in the site administrator.</p><h3>Site and Administrator</h3><p>Your site actually has two separate sites. The site (also called the front end) is what visitors to your site will see. The administrator (also called the back end) is only used by people managing your site. You can access the administrator by clicking the "Site Administrator" link on the "User Menu" menu (visible once you login) or by adding /administrator to the end of your domain name. The same user name and password are used for both sites.</p><h3>Learn more</h3><p>There is much more to learn about how to use Joomla! to create the website you envision. You can learn much more at the <a href="https://docs.joomla.org/" target="_blank">Joomla! documentation site</a> and on the<a href="https://forum.joomla.org/" target="_blank"> Joomla! forums</a>.</p> Toggle editor Status Published Unpublished Archived Trashed Category * Uncategorised News Sport Travel Culture Uncategorised Featured Yes No Access Public Guest Registered Special Super Users Public Language All English (en-GB) All Tags Joomla TagSU TagRegistered TagSpecial TagForSU Joomla Version Note Intro Image × Change Image Cancel Select Image Float Use Global (Left) Right Left None Use Global (Left) Alt Text Caption Full Article Image × Change Image Cancel Select Image Float Use Global (Left) Right Left None Use Global (Left) Alt Text Caption Link A Link A Text URL Target Window Use Global (Open in parent window) Open in parent window Open in new window Open in popup Modal Use Global (Open in parent window) Link B Link B Text URL Target Window Use Global (Open in parent window) Open in parent window Open in new window Open in popup Modal Use Global (Open in parent window) Link C Link C Text URL Target Window Use Global (Open in parent window) Open in parent window Open in new window Open in popup Modal Use Global (Open in parent window) Layout Use Global Default Use Global Show Title Use Global (Show) Show Hide Linked Titles Use Global (Yes) No Yes Show Tags Use Global (Show) Show Hide Show Intro Text Use Global (Show) Show Hide Position of Article Info Use Global (Above) Above Below Split Use Global (Above) Article Info Title Use Global (Show) Hide Show Show Category Use Global (Show) Hide Show Link Category Use Global (Yes) No Yes Show Parent Use Global (Hide) Hide Show Link Parent Use Global (No) No Yes Show Associations Use Global (Hide) Show Hide Show Author Use Global (Show) Hide Show Link Author Use Global (No) No Yes Show Create Date Use Global (Hide) Hide Show Show Modify Date Use Global (Hide) Hide Show Show Publish Date Use Global (Show) Hide Show Show Navigation Use Global (Show) Hide Show Show Icons Use Global (Hide) Hide Show Show Print Use Global (Hide) Hide Show Show Email Use Global (Hide) Hide Show Show Voting Use Global (Hide) Hide Show Show Hits Use Global (Hide) Hide Show Show Unauthorised Links Use Global (No) No Yes Positioning of the Links Use Global (Above) Above Below Read More Text Browser Page Title FieldGroupSpecial FieldSpecial * FieldRegistered Start Publishing ‹ 2019 › ‹ October › wk Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat 39 29 30 1 2 3 4 5 40 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 41 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 42 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 43 27 28 29 30 31 1 2 44 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 000102030405060708091011121314151617181920212223 000102030405060708091011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344454647484950515253545556575859   ClearTodayClose Finish Publishing ‹ 2020 › ‹ March › wk Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 10 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 11 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 12 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 13 29 30 31 1 2 3 4 14 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 000102030405060708091011121314151617181920212223 000102030405060708091011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344454647484950515253545556575859   ClearTodayClose Created Date ‹ 2019 › ‹ October › wk Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat 39 29 30 1 2 3 4 5 40 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 41 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 42 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 43 27 28 29 30 31 1 2 44 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 000102030405060708091011121314151617181920212223 000102030405060708091011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344454647484950515253545556575859   ClearTodayClose Created By × Select User Cancel Created by Alias Modified Date Modified By Revision Hits ID Meta Description Meta Keywords Key Reference Robots Use Global Index, Follow No index, follow Index, No follow No index, no follow Use Global Author Content Rights External Reference Show Publishing Options Use Global (Yes) No Yes Show Article Options Use Global (Yes) No Yes Administrator Images and Links Use Global (Yes) No Yes Frontend Images and Links Use Global (No) No Yes Manage the permission settings for the user groups below.
