In truth, the big creative breakthroughs are also a social process, often occurring when a diverse population comes together. Historically, cities are an essential ingredient for creating great art, from Classical Athens and Renaissance Florence to post-war New York and swinging London.   And where the artists go, others follow. In recent decades the process of gentrification has become well established. The academic Richard Florida popularised the theory in the early 2000s that creativity enables urban development: bohemians and artists move to inner-city, working-class or abandoned industrial areas in search of cheaper accommodation and studio space. They make a place fun and interesting, and the creative middle classes are then drawn to these open-minded  communities ­ – and the culture and amenities that come with them.   Mexico City Sharjah Belgrade Dakar Bangkok You are here:   Home Culture Popular Tags Joomla Latest Articles The five most creative cities in the world Germanys tiny geographic oddity Transfer news: Done deals in transfer window in October Libra: PayPal first to drop out of Facebook cryptocurrency Facebook's Libra could be misused, says treasury chief Mnuchin User Menu Your Profile Submit an Article Login Form Hi Author 1, Back to Top © 2020 SUT
